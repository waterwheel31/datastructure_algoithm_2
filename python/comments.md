#### Porject1

Used linked list implementation using Node class. By doing so, the efficiency becomes O(1) in terms of both time and space (this is not O(n) since the cache size is fixed) 


#### Project2

uUsed recurrsive algorithm since the depth of the directory is not sure. 
Considering the recurssivenessl, space complexity is O (m x n) where m is the number of directories and n is the number of files per directory. This can be simplified as O(N) where N is the total number of files. 

Time efficiency is O(n) where n is number of the files + directories

#### Project3

Huffman coding is good for compressing, but it seems the efficiency is not so much efficient. It is O(n log(n)) since there is need of sorting at the beginning. 

#### Project4

Used recurrsive algorithm since the depth is unknown. 
Memory efficiency is O(m) where m is the number of groups.
Time efficiency is O(n) where n is the number of users

#### Project5

Blockchain is kind of a linked list. 
Since the data are all stored in each block and not in blockchain, the efficiency is O(n) for time and space. 

#### Project6

Used linked list. The efficiency is O(n) for time and space
