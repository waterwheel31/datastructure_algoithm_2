#### Porject1

Used linked list implementation using Node class. By doing so, the efficiency becomes O(1) in terms of both time and space (this is not O(n) since the cache size is fixed) 


#### Project2

used recurrsive algorithm since the depth of the directory is not sure. The efficiency is O(n) for time and memory where n is number of folders + files 

#### Project3

Huffman coding is good for compressing, but it seems the efficiency is not so much efficient. It is O(n), since it is needed to search all the nodes in worst cases. 

#### Project4

Used recurrsive algorithm since the depth is unknown. The efficiency is O(n) where n is number of groups and users

#### Project5

Blockchain is kind of a linked list. 
Since the data are all stored in each block and not in blockchain, the efficiency is O(n) for time and space. 

#### Project6

Used linked list. The efficiency is O(n) for time and space
